                <h3>10/10 - Could Mountain (7.2)</h3>
                <p>Law took on the romantic lead in this epic Civil War story opposite Nicole Kidman. Law plays a
                    soldier who, after getting wounded in the war, attempts to make his way back to his sweetheart
                    (Kidman) as she struggles to maintain her family home.

                    Cold Mountain is a sweeping love story that feels like something out of the Hollywood studios would
                    have made in the 1950s. Law and Kidman are impressive in the lead roles and they are joined by a
                    stellar cast including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, and Renee Zellweger.</p>

                <h3>9/10 - Rise of the guardian (7.3)</h3>
                <p>Law provided his voice to this animated adventure film, Rise of the Guardians. Hugh Jackman, Alec
                    Baldwin, and Chris Pine provide the voices of such characters as the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus
                    who must team up to fight the evil spirit, Pitch (voiced by Law).</p>

            <li>
                <h3>8/10 - The Talented Mr. Ripley (7.4)</h3>
                <p>Law earned his first Oscar nomination for this gripping thriller. Matt Damon stars as a man with a
                    unique talent for imitating others. When he is brought into the inner circle of a rich shipping heir
                    (Law) living in Italy, he becomes obsessed with the man's life.

                    The movie is an intense journey with Damon's sociopathic character who finds his obsessions and lies
                    spiraling out of control. Damon gives one of his best performances and Law is just as riveting. It's
                    a slow burn story that holds your attention from beginning to end.</p>

                <h3>7/10 - Sherlock Holmes: A game of shadows (7.5)</h3>
                <p>Law and Robert Downey Jr. returned to their popular Sherlock Holmes franchise for this sequel. With
                    Law's Dr. Watson beginning his married life, he is reluctantly dragged on an adventure with Sherlock
                    Holmes (Downey Jr.) to track down the mysterious and dangerous Dr. Moriarty.

                    Law and Downey Jr. prove to have outstanding chemistry as the main duo which results in a lot of the
                    movie's charm. Jared Harris also makes for a great villain and the overall story is a pretty fun and
                    gripping adventure.</p>

                <h3>6/10 - Hugo (7.5)</h3>
                <p>Law had the chance to work with acclaimed filmmaker Martin Scorsese in the director's first
                    children's movie. Hugo told the story of a young orphaned boy living in a train station who is
                    trying to solve a mystery left behind by his father, playing by Law.

                <h3>5/10 - Enemy at the gates (7.6)</h3>
                <p>Law got one of his first action hero roles in the intense war drama Enemy at the Gates. Set in World
                    War II, Law plays a Russian sniper in Stalingrad who becomes renowned for his deadly accuracy. Soon
                    he finds himself in a game of cat-and-mouse with a German marksman with victory hanging in the
                    balance.

                    The movie plays fast and loose with historical accuracy, but it is nonetheless a thrilling war
                    story. Law makes for a fine lead and carries the film through its grim and violent story.

                <h3>4/10 - Sherlock Holmes (7.6)</h3>
                <p>Law and Downey Jr. played their detective duo for the first time in this Guy Ritchie film. As Holmes
                    and Watson deal with changes in their relationship, Holmes finds himself in the midst of a case with
                    seemingly supernatural elements as an old enemy seemingly returns from the grave.

                    The movie is a fun and stylish take on the classic literary character. Once again, the chemistry
                    between the leads is a lot of fun and Ritchie handles the big-budget action feel of the film
                    effectively.</p>

                <h3>3/10 - Road to perdition (7.7)</h3>
                <p>Law got the chance to play one of his few villainous roles in this excellent gangster movie. Tom
                    Hanks plays an enforcer for the Irish mob who is forced to go on the run with his son after his
                    former associates take aim at him and his family. Law plays a sadistic hitman on their trail.</p>

                <h3>2/10 - Gattaca (7.8)</h3>
                <p>Law caught the attention of many people with his early performance in the sci-fi drama Gattaca. The
                    film is set in a futuristic society where those considered perfect beings are given a better life
                    than those considered inferior. Ethan Hawke plays a man who switches place with a member of the
                    upper class, played by Law.

                    Like all good science-fiction stories, Gattaca explores a futuristic story that relates to the
                    society we live in today. The sharply written film is thought-provoking and entertaining. It is also
                    elevated by great performances, especially Law as a privileged but bitter man.</p>

                <h3>1/10 - The Gran Budapest Hotel (8.1)</h3>
                <p>Law had the opportunity to join the magical world of Wes Anderson in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Law
                    plays an author visiting the titular hotel who is recounted with an exciting story of the
                    establishment's earlier days when it was overseen by a dedicated concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph
                    Fiennes).

                    The movie has the same charm and unique humor that makes all of Anderson's films so special. It also
                    features a fantastic cast, led by a hilarious and captivating performance from Fiennes. It is a
                    wild, strange and hugely entertaining adventure like only Anderson can deliver.</p>
